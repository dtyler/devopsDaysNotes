Networking with Git
===================
Git as repo for text files

Applying git to networking
    * version control
    * code reviews
    * rollback 
    * forking for new projects, datacenter, office

Downside
    * still need to get on-box changes committed back
        * Ansible/puppet
        * Organizational behavior/culture
    * Vendors are bad at rollback
    * Typos can cause chaos
