Lightning Talks
==============

Devops Toolkit
--------------
Devops is good.
Consider supply chains practices when building your devops approach

Networking, Headhunters, and LinkedIn (Oh, my!)
------------------------------------- 
Claim: It can take 6 months to find a job through "active" job searching

* Open Networking - Accepting "All the connections" to ensure you get connected to the hiring manager hiring your next job (perhaps before they even post it)

Quantifying Tech Debt
---------------------
Getting people to easily document/quantify tech debt

* Get devs to add comments with precieved tech debt, tagged with some sort of "T-shirt sizes". 
* Use Jenkins task skinner pluging (Or soemthing else) to do reporting on these tasks
* Do reviews to help devs size correctly
