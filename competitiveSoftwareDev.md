* Silos limit scope
* Specialization encourages ownership and accountability
* Specialization increases communication channels/ feedback loops
* Specialization -> "Head on a swivel"
* Specialization all roles on the team. Every one has the same

* Competition
    * Have internal competition with short-term goals
        * role-base 
    * Example
        * Hackathon to "devops-ize" an app
* Mission focus

        * Good
        * possible
        * ownership/relevancy -> each person can impact the success of the mission
    * definition
        * who
